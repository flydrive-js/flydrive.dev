# AWS S3

You may use the [S3 Driver](https://github.com/flydrive-js/core/blob/develop/drivers/s3/driver.ts) to manage files using AWS S3. Make sure to install the following peer dependencies in your project.

```sh
npm i @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner @aws-sdk/client-s3
```

Once done, you can create an instance of the S3 Driver and use it as follows.

```ts
import { Disk } from 'flydrive'
import { S3Driver } from 'flydrive/drivers/s3'

const disk = new Disk(
  new S3Driver({
    credentials: {
      accessKeyId: 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY',
      secretAccessKey: 'AWS_ACCESS_SECRET',
    },
    region: 'S3_REGION',
    bucket: 'S3_BUCKET',
    visibility: 'private',
  })
)
```

You can pass all the options accepted by the [@aws-sdk/client-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/client-s3) package to the `S3Driver` along with the following/required options.

<dl>

<dt>

bucket

</dt>

<dd>

The `bucket` option defines the S3 bucket to use for managing files.

</dd>

<dt>

visibility

</dt>

<dd>

The `visibility` option specifies the [ACL property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/client/s3/command/PutObjectCommand/#:~:text=input%20%3D%20%7B%20//%20PutObjectRequest-,ACL%3A,-%22private%22%20%7C%7C) of the object while writing it to the S3 bucket.

- The `public` visibility sets the ACL to `public-read`.
- The `private` visibility sets the ACL to `private`.

</dd>

<dt>

supportsACL

</dt>

<dd>

Specify if the cloud service supports per-object ACL. For example, Cloudflare R2 does not support per-object ACL and does not implement the ACL commands.

Therefore, you must set the `supportsACL = false` when using R2 or any other S3 compatible service that does not support ACL.

</dd>

<dt>

cdnUrl

</dt>

<dd>

The `cdnUrl` property can be used to define the base URL for [generating public URL](#creating-public-urls) for a file. For example, If you use CloudFront alongside S3 to serve public files, the `cdnUrl` property should be the CloudFront URL.

</dd>

<dt>

urlBuilder

</dt>

<dd>

Define a custom URL builder for creating public and signed URLs. [Learn more](#creating-public-urls)

</dd>

</dl>

## Using an existing S3 client
If you already have an instance of `S3Client` from the `@aws-sdk/client-s3` package. You may pass it directly to the Flydrive `S3Driver` as follows.

```ts
import { S3Driver } from 'flydrive/drivers/s3'
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3'

// highlight-start
const client = new S3Client({})
// highlight-end

const driver = new S3Driver({
  // highlight-start
  client: client,
  // highlight-end
  bucket: 'S3_BUCKET',
  visibility: 'private',
})
```

## Creating public URLs
Public URLs can be created for files uploaded to S3 with `public` visibility. The public URL can point to a CDN if you have configured the `cdnUrl` inside the driver config. Otherwise, it will fallback to [virtual hosted-style AWS URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html#virtual-hosted-style-access). For example:

```ts
// title: When CDN URL is configured
const disk = new Disk(
  new S3Driver({
    cdnUrl: 'https://djs74oztd4h.cloudfront.net',
    bucket: 'testing-drive'
  })
)

const URL = await disk.getUrl('avatar.png')
console.log(URL) // https://djs74oztd4h.cloudfront.net/avatar.png
```

```ts
// title: When CDN URL is not configured
const disk = new Disk(
  new S3Driver({
    // delete-start
    cdnUrl: 'https://djs74oztd4h.cloudfront.net',
    // delete-end
    bucket: 'testing-drive'
  })
)

const URL = await disk.getUrl('avatar.png')
console.log(URL) // https://testing-drive.s3.amazonaws.com/avatar.png
```

You may also self create a public URL by defining a custom URL builder within the config. For example:

```ts
// title: Self generating public URLs
const disk = new Disk(
  new S3Driver({
    bucket: 'testing-drive',
    // insert-start
    urlBuilder: {
      async generateURL(key, bucket, s3Client) {
        return `https://some-custom-url/files/${bucket}/${key}`
      }
    }
    // insert-end
  })
)

const URL = await disk.getUrl('avatar.png')
console.log(URL) // https://some-custom-url/files/testing-drive/avatar.png
```

## Creating signed URLs
Signed URLs are created to provide time-based access to a private file hosted on S3. For example:

```ts
const disk = new Disk(
  new S3Driver({})
)

const signedURL = await disk.getSignedUrl('invoice.pdf', {
  expiresIn: '30mins'
})
```

At the time of generating the signed URL, you can pass one of the following options along with the options accepted by [GetObjectCommand](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/client/s3/command/GetObjectCommand/) class.

```ts
await disk.getSignedUrl('invoice.pdf', {
  expiresIn: '30mins',
  contentType: 'application/pdf',
  contentDisposition: 'attachment',

  /**
   * Additional options applicable for S3 only
   */
  ResponseCacheControl: 'max-age=604800'
})
```
